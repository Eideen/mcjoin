.Sh NAME
.Nm mcjoin
.Nd tiny multicast testing tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dhjqsv
.Op Fl c Ar COUNT
.Op Fl i Ar IFNAME
.Op Fl p Ar PORT
.Op Fl r Ar SEC
.Op Fl t Ar TTL
.Op Ar GROUP0 .. GROUPN | GROUP+NUM
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can be used to join IPv4 multicast groups, display progress as multicast
packets are received, and also send multicast packets on select groups.
.Pp
.Nm
can help verify intended IGMP snooping functionality in layer-2 bridges
(switches), as well as verify forwarding of multicast in static or
dynamic multicast routing setups.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar COUNT
Stop after sending/receiving COUNT number of packets
.It Fl d
Debug output
.It Fl h
Print a summary of the options and exit
.It Fl i Ar IFNAME
Interface to use for sending/receiving multicast, default: eth0
.It Fl j
Join groups, default unless acting as sender
.It Fl p Ar PORT
UDP port number to listen to, default: 1234
.It Fl q
Quiet mode
.It Fl s
Act as sender, sends packets to select groups, default: no
.It Fl r Ar SEC
Do leave/join repeatedly every SEC seconds
.It Fl t Ar TTL
TTL to use when sending multicast packets, default: 1
.It Fl v
Show version information
.El
.Sh USAGE
To verify multicast connectivity, the simplest way is to run
.Nm
on one system, without arguments, and on the other with the command
option
.Ar -s .
In this setup one system joins the group
.Ar 225.1.2.3
waiting for packets to arrive, and the other end starts sending packets
to the same group.  To verify routing of multicast, make sure to add the
.Ar -t TTL
option to the sender since the default TTL is 1 and every router
(simplified) decrements the TTL.
.Pp
For a more advanced example, say you want to verify that your topology
can forward 20 consecutive groups in the MCAST_TEST_NET, as defined in
RFC5771.  Simply add the following as a standalone argument to both the
receiver and the sender:
.Ar 233.252.0.1+20
.Pp
For non-consecutive groups, simply add them in any order you want, up to
250 groups are supported:
.Ar 225.1.2.3 226.3.2.1+12 225.3.2.42 232.43.211.234
