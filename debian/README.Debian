mcjoin for Debian
-----------------

(Mar 6th, 2016)

mcjoin is a small multicast helper tool.  It can be used to join one or
more IPv4 multicast groups on any interface.  It can also both receive
and send multicast on said grops.  When joining on an interface that is
not the default gateway a -r SEC argument can be used to ensure that
mcjoin rejoins the stream(s) every N seconds.

Don't use it on the Internet.
