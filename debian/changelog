mcjoin (2.0-1) wily; urgency=low

  * New upstream relase. Adds support for actings as sender as well as
    to, not only join, but also receive multicast packets.
  * Please note that `--long-options` are no more and that some options have
    been removed altogether.  For instance `-f FIRST` and `-n NUM` options
    have been changed to command arguments on the form `GROUP+NUM`, which
    integrates better with the rest of the syntax.

mcjoin (1.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Take care to setup symlink in /usr/local/bin/mcjoin as well, and remove
    it in both preinst and postrm.  This to handle systems with a locally
    built older version.
