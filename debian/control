Description: IPv4 tool for verifying multicast connectivity.
 mcjoin can be used to join IPv4 multicast groups, display
 progress as multicast packets are received, and also send
 multicast packets on select groups.
 .
 mcjoin can help verify intended IGMP snooping functionality
 in layer-2 bridges/switches, as well as test forwarding of
 multicast in static or dynamic multicast routing setups.
