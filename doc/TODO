TODOs in no particular order.

- Add Ctrl-L support to refresh display when garbled, e.g. kernel output on embedded device
- Screen does not restore to cooked state if exiting due to no IP on interface yet
- Fix plotter artefacts, that look like packet loss, while resizing window.
  Likely needs a big refactor to unify the update timer and the socket poll()
  in the receiver.  Best course of action would be to add a proper event lib.
  But that requires one that is portable across multiple UNIX systems.
- Fix IPv4 + IPv6 address validator in addr.c, see XXX
- Add option to also log to syslog when running with new ui, not just log window on screen
- gaps/dupes/reordering detection by checking seq n:o
- add `-J MSEC` for addning MSEC jitter to sender
- adjustable source port?
- seqno start
- countdown to next packet
