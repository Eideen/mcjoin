TODOs in no particular order.

- Show uptime/runtime above clock, useful when using -f odd-num
- Add Ctrl-L support to refresh display when garbled, e.g. kernel output on embedded device
- Improve plotter output by adding special characters for dupes, gaps, and delays.
  Gaps in stream are shown as ' ' (space), but we don't know why they happen.
  We could insert, as the next char after the gap, the reason, like this:

        ............  normal flow moving left
	....:.......  dupes, same seqno
        ..... X.....  lost (gap) packet
        ..... _.....  delayed packet

- Fix IPv4 + IPv6 address validator in addr.c, see XXX
- Add option to also log to syslog when running with new ui, not just log window on screen
- gaps/dupes/reordering detection by checking seq n:o
- option to show summary of gaps/dupes/bytes in log every 10 sec or so
- add `-J MSEC` for addning MSEC jitter to sender
- adjustable source port?
- seqno start
- countdown to next packet
